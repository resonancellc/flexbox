FADE IN:

We are in the belly of a wave.
Light refracts in a constant collision of water.
SLOW MOTION, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid
diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...


EXT.  OCEAN - DUSK

Backlit against a flaming sun a solitary SURFER glides
across the green glassy peak.  TIME IS STRETCHED until his
movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world.
Total Zen concentration.  Body weight centered, eyes
forward and on the next section.


EXT.  URBAN STREET - DUSK

SLOW MOTION ON a black sedan.
Creeping along store fronts.  Past a Winchell's.
PEOPLE splash steps down rain-washed sidewalks in DREAM
MOTION.  The sedan turns past the FIRST VIRGINIA BANK and
into an alley.


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

TWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats
and hats.  Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch
taut from the base of their nose to their forehead,
hideously distorting their features.  Makes them look like
human PIGS.


EXT.  OCEAN

SILVERY in this light, almost metallic, as if from some
future-scape.  The lone surfer SHREDS a long, endless
right wall.
ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit,
digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers
down.
His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied--


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

An M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a
CACHACK!  Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts
and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI.
Watches are checked.  The PIG NOSE people nod to each
other.


EXT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors,
slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast.


EXT.  OCEAN

FAST NOW -- the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face
of the wave.  The surfer TRIMS down the line, pivoting the
board and going straight down, CARVING the bottom.  He
slashes viciously back toward the lip and--

In a radical INVERTED AIR ATTACK sails SIX feet above the
wave in an explosion of water--


INT.  BANK

--BAAAAAAMMM!
Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.  He
fires a burst into the ceiling.  BRRAAMM!!

PIG NOSE #1
EVERYBODY on the floor!

PEOPLE drop.
VERY FAST HERE--
Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers--
Another PIG NOSE watches the door--
Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in
hand.


INT.  SURVEILLANCE VAN

Dark. Monitors SHOW SLOW SCANS of the bank INTERIOR.
Two MEN wear headphones and black windbreakers with FBI
stenciled on the back.  One watches with binoculars.

BINOCULARS
Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go.
Where's the big college
quarterback?!  Are you with us,
Utah?


EXT.  BANK WALL

A MAN in his twenties.  His head spins revealing rain-
slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright.  An edgy
handsomeness to him.
He pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun
on one leg and leans against the wall.  He wears a
headset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for
him.
This is JOHNNY UTAH.

BINOCULARS (FILTERED)
Utah, where the hell are ya!?

Utah takes his headset off...


INT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1 LEAPS over the counter, holds a canvas sack
filled with booty from tellers' drawers.

PIG NOSE #1
Fuckin' shake it!

Pig Nose #2 nods with his snubby nose, hurries toward the
exit.


EXT.  FIRST VIRGINIA BANK

The bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the
alley where they jump into the SEDAN.  THE DRIVER, the
WOMAN PIG NOSE, punches it and the TIRES WHIRRR on the
slick pavement.
The sedan launches down the alley.

Utah running.  Like a freight train.  Splashing through a
cross-alley.  He doesn't break stride as he slams his
shoulder into a large, steel GARBAGE DUMPSTER.
DRIVING it like a football training sled into the ALLEY
where--

THE SEDAN LOCKS 'EM UP seconds too late as it SKIDS and
SLAMS into it, CRUNCHING into the brick wall and--
Still alive -- GRINDS into reverse back down the alley,
HEADLIGHTS SMASHED, it guns it backward as--

UTAH leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car.
He has a brick in his right hand.  He cocks it back.
Johnny HEAVES the brick thirty yards and--

SMASH!  The brick EXPLODES into the windshield,
SPIDERWEBBING the glass.
Lady Pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into
her face.

LADY PIGNOSE
Son of a bitch!

The car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked
car.  Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the
wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement.

UTAH hurtles from the alley.  He leaps, somehow TACKLES
the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street.
He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips
the steering wheel hard right.

The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces
forward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and
crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam
whistles hot.

Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his
crushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door.
Gropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a
lady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and
again until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the
woman collapses in pain.

Pig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot.  Utah
leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the
shotgun.

UTAH
Halt.  FBI!

Pig Nose #1 spins.  We sense reckless anger.  He raises
the UZI.  Utah squeezes the trigger.

No death.  No blood.
Just buzzers and flashing bulbs.
Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine.
Utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone".  Pig Nose rips
the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in
disgust.

OBSERVERS step forward.  Bank customers.  Bank tellers.
All FBI personnel.  MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver
assistance.  Pig Nose #1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued
by other agents.
